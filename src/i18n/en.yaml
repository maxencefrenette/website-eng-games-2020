30th-edition: 30th edition
jdg: Engineering Games
tagline: Change the world
3-pillars: Our 3 Pillars
pillar1: Diversity and Inclusion
pillar1-message:
  The Engineering Games is also a community united by the pride of studying engineering. 
  A welcoming and loving community, one that cares about including and celebrating the presence of everyone 
  from a diverse background, since it is precisely this diversity that makes the engineering student community 
  so rich and strong.
pillar2: Sustainability
pillar2-message:
  In 2020, sustainability will be a priority to ensure a quality of life for future generations. 
  It is about time to exploit the influence of the professional body and the next generation is a fertile ground 
  for raising awareness. The Engineering Games will test the skills of its participants to act responsibly while 
  promoting a positive social, environmental and economic impact through our carbon neutral event.
pillar3: Technical Excellence
pillar3-message:
  Our event is a bridge between newly acquired knowledge and the applications of today's industry. 
  After more than 4 months of preparation, participants will tackle tough and exciting challenges that showcase 
  not only the expertise of local organizations, but also the talent of tomorrow's engineers.
history: History
history-text:
  "For the past 29 years, Engineering Games has been the largest engineering competition in Quebec
  and the biggest gathering of engineering students in the province. Participants, from 12
  universities in Quebec and Ontario, test their general and specific skills, complementary to those
  of the engineering profession, by confronting challenges of a varied nature. For the thirtieth
  edition, the event will take place from January 3 to 7, 2020 at the École de technologie
  supérieure in Montreal."
mission-2020: "Theme : JDG 2020 Mission"
mission-2020-text-1:
  The harmful consequences of human activities are causing the degradation of the ozone layer. The
  climatologists of the <a href="/downloads/press-release.pdf">Bureau of Engineering and Planning of
  Competitions Organized as Multidisciplinary (BEPCOM)</a>, ensure the imminence of a series of
  disasters which will have the effect of decimating all life on Earth at an alarming rate.
mission-2020-text-2:
  These unprecedented events will begin in September 2019. In view of the JDG2020 mission which will
  be held next January, each Quebec university is mandated to select, among the survivors, 40
  engineering students. This selection will be based on their ability to solve the complex problems
  associated with rebuilding a better world, sustainable and in their image. The objective of this
  mission is to improve the situation on Earth, preserve knowledge, responsibly use remaining
  resources and revitalize activities in a sustainable manner.

# Compétitions
competitions-text:
  "Engineering games is the largest engineering competition in Québec and the largest engineering student 
  gathering in the province. Participants will be required to measure their academic, technical, athletic 
  and social skills during this competition. They will need to demonstrate team spirit and personal achievement 
  in order to overcome the challenges they will face during this event."
machine: The Machine
machine-text:
  "<p>The competition of the robotic machine is the main challenge and the most difficult to overcome 
  within the Engineering Games. This is the only competition where the delegations are working on it 
  all fall long before the Games. The challenge is to manufacture a machine that will overcome the 
  various obstacles of a predetermined journey. The manufacture of this machine requires the training 
  of multidisciplinary teams that will have to invest a lot of time in order to achieve a highly 
  competitive prototype.</p>
  <p>Each team will have to work on ingeniousness and creativity as well as develop the synergy necessary 
  to create a robotic machine that meets the judges' expectations while respecting the specifications. 
  The participants in this competition will therefore use their engineering knowledge in addition to managing 
  a budget dedicated to the purchase of material resources and developing transformations to make 
  their ideas a reality. </p> 
  <p>The robotics machine competition is a highly publicized event open to the public and is the 
  pride of the delegations and the organizing committee.</p>"
entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship-text:
  <p>The entrepreneurship competition is a challenge that will lead its participants to apply 
  related and important skills in an innovative environment. This is one of the two competitions 
  that requires a lot of preparation before arriving at the engineering games.</p> 
  <p> The event, which is divided into three parts, includes the development and production of a 
  prototype for a new product that addresses a predefined issue, the writing of a business plan to 
  justify the choice of the product, its viability, and its implementation from the perspective of an 
  emerging company, as well as the preparation of a short sales speech to convince judges that this is 
  the best solution for the issue.</p>
  <p> Participants must have completed the prototype and business plan before they arrive at the Engineering Games. 
  The sales pitch will be made in front of a group of 3 to 5 judges who will then choose the 5 best products 
  in order to give these universities the opportunity to make their presentation in front of all the participants 
  of the engineering games on the last day.</p>
academic: Academic competitions
academic-text:
  <p>The academic exams include the six most taught engineering disciplines in Quebec in addition to the 
  consulting engineering category. The competitions take place in the morning during which the teams must 
  answer a theoretical questionnaire and carry out a practical test in the form of a montage, a laboratory 
  experiment or a case study related to a specific field of engineering. To do this, each delegation is divided 
  into sub-groups of four to six people according to the participants' fields of expertise and participants. 
  The latter thus take up a challenge covering all the topics covered during the their university education. 
  A challenge for the next generation of engineers!</p>
sports: Sports
sports-text:
  <p>It is by drawing inspiration from the adage "a healthy mind in a healthy body" that the sports events 
  have made their way into the competition program. The day dedicated to these events are an opportunity 
  for delegations to stand out in a field other than that of engineering and to demonstrate their versatility. 
  Sports tournaments will not only focus on on individual athletic skills but also on team spirit and effort, 
  two of the most important values of the competition.</p>
cultural: Cultural
cultural-text:
  <p>To add a little entertainment to all these events, cultural competitions are on the menu, including 
  improvisation, oratory debates and "génie en herbe". They allow delegations to showcase their hidden 
  talents and share their skills that complement those required in engineering. The improvisation competition 
  is an energetic and colourful evening, where teams use their imagination, receptiveness and speed of execution. 
  Oratory debates allow two participants from each university to demonstrate their oratory skills. They must 
  convince the judges by developing a strong argument that will supplant that of their opponents. 
  Then, the "génie en herbe" competition pits four members of each delegation against each other who will 
  use their general knowledge to answer questions on a variety of topics as quickly as possible.</p> 
  <p>Finally, we must not forget the cultural evening, which takes place in the form of a networking evening. 
  This is a golden opportunity to exchange and expand your professional network with partners in a very friendly 
  atmosphere.</p>
