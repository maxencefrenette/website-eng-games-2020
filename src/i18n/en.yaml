3-pillars: Our 3 Pillars
pillar1: Diversity and Inclusion
pillar1-message:
  The Engineering Games is also a community united by the pride of studying engineering. A welcoming
  and loving community, one that cares about including and celebrating the presence of everyone from
  a diverse background, since it is precisely this diversity that makes the engineering student
  community so rich and strong.
pillar2: Sustainability

  In 2020, sustainability will be a priority to ensure a quality of life for future generations. It
  is about time to exploit the influence of the professional body and the next generation is a
  fertile ground for raising awareness. The Engineering Games will test the skills of its
  participants to act responsibly while promoting a positive social, environmental and economic
  impact through our carbon neutral event.
pillar3: Technical Excellence
pillar3-message:
  Our event is a bridge between newly acquired knowledge and the applications of today's industry.
  After more than 4 months of preparation, participants will tackle tough and exciting challenges
  that showcase not only the expertise of local organizations, but also the talent of tomorrow's
  engineers.
history: History
history-text:
  "For the past 30 years, Engineering Games has been the largest engineering competition in Quebec
  and the biggest gathering of engineering students in the province. Participants, from 12
  universities in Quebec and Ontario, test their general and specific skills, complementary to those
  of the engineering profession, by confronting challenges of a varied nature. For the thirtieth
  edition, the event will take place from January 3 to 7, 2020 at the École de technologie
  supérieure in Montreal."
mission-2020: "Theme : JDG 2020 Mission"
mission-2020-text-1:
  The harmful consequences of human activities are causing the degradation of the ozone layer. The
  climatologists of the <a href="/jdg/2020/downloads/press-release.pdf">Bureau of Engineering and
  Planning of Competitions Organized as Multidisciplinary (BEPCOM)</a>, ensure the imminence of a
  series of disasters which will have the effect of decimating all life on Earth at an alarming
  rate.
mission-2020-text-2:
  These unprecedented events will begin in September 2019. In view of the JDG2020 mission which will
  be held next January, each Quebec university is mandated to select, among the survivors, 44
  engineering students. This selection will be based on their ability to solve the complex problems
  associated with rebuilding a better world, sustainable and in their image. The objective of this
  mission is to improve the situation on Earth, preserve knowledge, responsibly use remaining
  resources and revitalize activities in a sustainable manner.

# Compétitions
competitions-text:
  "Engineering games is the largest engineering competition in Québec and the largest engineering
  student gathering in the province. Participants will be required to measure their academic,
  technical, athletic and social skills during this competition. They will need to demonstrate team
  spirit and personal achievement in order to overcome the challenges they will face during this
  event."
machine: The Machine
machine-text:
  "<p>The robotic machine competition is the main event and the most difficult challenge of the
  Engineering Games. This is one of the events that requires sustained work by delegations
  throughout the fall before the Games. The challenge is to manufacture a machine that will overcome
  the various obstacles of a predetermined journey. The manufacture of this machine requires the
  training of multidisciplinary teams that will have to invest a lot of time in order to achieve a
  highly competitive prototype.</p> <p>Each team will have to work on ingeniousness and creativity
  as well as develop the synergy necessary to create a robotic machine that meets the judges'
  expectations while respecting the specifications. The participants in this competition will
  therefore use their engineering knowledge in addition to managing a budget dedicated to the
  purchase of material resources and developing transformations to make their ideas a reality. </p>
  <p>The robotics machine competition is a highly publicized event open to the public and is the
  pride of the delegations and the organizing committee.</p>"
entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship-text:
  <p>The entrepreneurship competition is a challenge that will lead its participants to apply
  related and important skills in an innovative environment. This is one of the two competitions
  that requires a lot of preparation before arriving at the engineering games.</p> <p> The event,
  which is divided into three parts, includes the development and production of a prototype for a
  new product that addresses a predefined issue, the writing of a business plan to justify the
  choice of the product, its viability, and its implementation from the perspective of an emerging
  company, as well as the preparation of a short sales speech to convince judges that this is the
  best solution for the issue.</p> <p> Participants must have completed the prototype and business
  plan before they arrive at the Engineering Games. The sales pitch will be made in front of a group
  of 3 to 5 judges who will then choose the 5 best products in order to give these universities the
  opportunity to make their presentation in front of all the participants of the engineering games
  on the last day.</p>
academic: Academic competitions
academic-text:
  <p>The academic exams include the six most taught engineering disciplines in Quebec in addition to
  the consulting engineering category. The competitions take place in the morning during which the
  teams must answer a theoretical questionnaire and carry out a practical test in the form of a
  montage, a laboratory experiment or a case study related to a specific field of engineering. To do
  this, each delegation is divided into sub-groups of four to six people according to the
  participants' fields of expertise and participants. The latter thus take up a challenge covering
  all the topics covered during the their university education. A challenge for the next generation
  of engineers!</p>
sports: Sports
sports-text:
  <p>It is by drawing inspiration from the adage "a healthy mind in a healthy body" that the sports
  events have made their way into the competition program. The day dedicated to these events are an
  opportunity for delegations to stand out in a field other than that of engineering and to
  demonstrate their versatility. Sports tournaments will not only focus on on individual athletic
  skills but also on team spirit and effort, two of the most important values of the
  competition.</p>
cultural: Cultural
cultural-text:
  <p>To add a little entertainment to all these events, cultural competitions are on the menu,
  including improvisation, oratory debates and "génie en herbe". They allow delegations to showcase
  their hidden talents and share their skills that complement those required in engineering. The
  improvisation competition is an energetic and colourful evening, where teams use their
  imagination, receptiveness and speed of execution. Oratory debates allow two participants from
  each university to demonstrate their oratory skills. They must convince the judges by developing a
  strong argument that will supplant that of their opponents. Then, the "génie en herbe" competition
  pits four members of each delegation against each other who will use their general knowledge to
  answer questions on a variety of topics as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Finally, we must not forget
  the cultural evening, which takes place in the form of a networking evening. This is a golden
  opportunity to exchange and expand your professional network with partners in a very friendly
  atmosphere.</p>
